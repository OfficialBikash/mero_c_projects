## Introduction
The customer management system is a software application that helps business in managing customer relationships, interactions and helps in record-keeping.  It can help business to reduce costs, collect data, implement systematic billing systems, check out purchase history, keep up-to-date records of transactions, enabling entities to better serve and understand their customers.

We have sub-divided project into three sub-topics:

1. Bank management system

2. Hospital management system

3. Store-keeping management system


### Hospital management system:
Additionally, a user can put the total amount needed to be paid by customers, the total amount paid, and due amount. As well, if a patient has opened membership facilities in the concerned organization, then he/she will be automatically discounted some portion of payments in records management.

### Bank management system:

At the initial time, when a new customer would come to the bank, user would be able to open current , saving or fixed account for them. User can add the deposit of cash in all three accounts whereas  only the account holder will be able to withdraw money in daily basis if they have current or saving account  but for fixed deposit they can withdraw when fixed deposit maturity date comes to an end.

### Store-keeping management system:

When a consumer purchases products, the record of the number of products will get diminished in  records and it  influences the total revenue of the store too.

Expected outcome
According to our anticipation, this project would assists business in tracking their product sales and customer purchases, concise information about debit and credit of cash by or to depositors as well as an accurate billing system.


## Why these three management systems?

There are multiple types of enterprises and according to the nature of business the management of customers distinguishes from each other . We reached to conclusion this project should be combination of three business sectors that deals with customers on a large size in daily basis. Most precisely, it is flexible system , as it can be modified based on ownerâ€™s demand.

In all three management systems, similar features have been added.
Such as:

1. Creating new records,

2. Manipulating records (i.e delete, update , search, and view  saved records)

3. Organized billing system is available.

 ## Objectives
- Free access of source code to interested programmer.
-To aid business entities in customer management work.
- Make code  flexible  so that user can have their  sector relevant customer management system.

3. Easy to customize data.

4. Strong security measures to safeguard data.
